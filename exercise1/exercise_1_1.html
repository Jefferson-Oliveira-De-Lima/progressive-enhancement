        <h2>What is "semantics"?</h2>
        <p>A sentence is a series of words. A title is also a series of words. And so is a subtitle. How can a computer know which is which? Semantics is about marking up what a series of information is to be considered as. It adds hierarchy and structure to a text. That's what HTML is for.</p>
        <p>To make proper HTML code, one must think not about the looks of the text, but of its structure <em>ðŸ’–</em>.</p>
        <p>How? When writing html code, ask yourself this question: "What is this series of words: a date? A title? A paragraph? A legend? A caption describing an image? And this series of sentences, is this a chapter? A footnote?" The answer to that question will tell you which HTML tag to best use to describe the content.</p>

        <h2>Why is semantics so important?</h2>
        <p>Two reasons: SEO (your website's findability / visibility on Google) and Accessibility (make sure all humans, no matter their handicap (blindness, poor eyesight, colorblindness) can access the information.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>1.1 SEO</h3>
            <p>The ultimate goal of a search engine like Google is to return to a human the best possible results for what they have searched for (a few words). To do this, Google creates software such as Googlebot, which indexes content found on the web by following links from one page to another, from one site to another. (That's why we sometimes talk about web spiders).</p>
            <p>Using powerful algorithms, Google reads and analyzes the HTML content of each page found, in order to "understand" what it is talking about thanks to its html structure (title, subtitle, list, etc.). This allows Google to determine what each page is about, and if it seems to match the search, it will return it to the user as one of the first results.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if our pages are not very semantic, Google will not show them, and your sites, no matter how cool they look and feel, will not have any traffic.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Accessibility</h3>
            <p>The web is a universal project: everyone must have access to content. Including the blind and visually impaired (you, one day). Blind people use "screen readers" that use html code to tell the story aloud. If your html code is not semantic, the page will not make much sense to listen to (even if it looks good).

        <h2>Semantic is actually pretty easy.</h2>
        <p>Semantics consists in choosing the right tags and attributes to represent your content. Do keep in mind that too much semantics hurts semantics. The rule (as often in programming) is: as little code as possible, but as much as necessary.</p>

        <h3>Tags</h3>
        <p>Tags are used to indicate the semantic function of a portion of content in "blocks". Most html blocks work with an opening tag and a closing tag.</p>

            <figcaption>Syntax example :</figcaption>
            <blockquote>
                <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph (hence the P letter).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

        <h2>Exercises :</h2>
        <p>Translate this text document into semantic html, using the right html tags: h1, h2, blockquote, q, img, hr, figure and caption, table, th, tr, td, ul or ol and li.</p>
        <p>No div or span: they do not provide any semantics.</p>
        <p>Find, for each of these tags, the origin of their name (that's how we remember them). If in doubt, look for the answer on <a href="https://html5doctor.com" target="_blank" title="HTML5 Doctor">html5doctor.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Add two or three links of your choice in the html page via the tag <a href="#">a</a></p>
        <p>Is there a part that could be considered as a header? If so, group it in a <code>header</code> tag.</p>
        <p>And a footer? If so, group this content together in a <code>footer</code> tag.</p>
        <p>Put all instances of the words "<em>Maybe</em>" in a <code>em</code> or <code>strong</code> tag.</p>
