            Once upon a time, there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. "That's bad news," said his neighbors.
            "Maybe," the farmer replied.

            The next day, the horse returned with a herd of wild horses. "That's good news!" said his neighbors.
            "Maybe," the farmer replied.
